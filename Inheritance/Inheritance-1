 /* Design a class employee of an organization. 
An employee has a name, empid, and salary. Write the default constructor, a constructor with parameters (name, empid, and salary) and methods to return name and salary.
Also write a method increaseSalary that raises the employeeâ€™s salary by a certain user specified percentage. Derive a subclass Manager from employee. 
Add an instance variable named department to the manager class. Supply a test program that uses theses classes and methods.  */
