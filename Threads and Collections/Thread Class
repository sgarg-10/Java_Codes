Write a program to implement the concept of threading by extending Thread Class and Runnable interface.

CODE:

//BY EXTENDING THREAD
import java.util.*;
class Main extends Thread  
{ 
    public void run() 
    { 
        System.out.println("Run method executed by child Thread"); 
    } 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        Main t = new Main(); 
        t.start(); 
        System.out.println("Main method executed by main thread"); 
    } 
}






//BY IMPLEMENTING RUNNABLE
class Test { 
    public static void m1() 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello Visitors"); 
    } 
} 
  

class Main extends Test implements Runnable { 
    public void run() 
    { 
        System.out.println("Run method executed by child Thread"); 
    } 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        Main t = new Main(); 
        t.m1(); 
        Thread t1 = new Thread(t); 
        t1.start(); 
        System.out.println("Main method executed by main thread"); 
    } 
}
